## HOW FIND KERNELS
'd suggest that you go to the device in question, for example:

ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
and obtain the major and minor node numbers. Let's say they are 116, 7

Then go to:

ls -l /sys/dev/char/116:7

Since I don't have your hardware I can't give you an exact answer.

I'd suggest that you go to the device in question, for example:

ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
and obtain the major and minor node numbers. Let's say they are 116, 7

Then go to:

ls -l /sys/dev/char/116:7
(char, because a tty is a character device, if you were tracing down a disk device you would specify block instead of char)

In the output from the command you will see something a little like:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Sep  6 00:17 116:7 -> ../../devices//sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.5/pci0000:00/0000:00:13.5/usb1/1-3/1-3:1.1/sound/card1/pcmC1D0c
